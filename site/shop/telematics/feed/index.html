		<description><![CDATA[PTT Link for Iridium Extreme PTT (Push-To-Talk)]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ASE continues to lead with accessories that enhance the experience and improve the performance of the<span>&nbsp;</span>Iridium 9575 PTT Extreme. The revolutionary Push-to-Talk (PTT) service of the Iridium satellite network is groundbreaking. New challenges presented themselves in using the Handset alone. Issues such as satellite blockage, microphone, and speaker volume arose in field testing. ASE has overcome these by providing the ASE PTT LINK accessory that allows the user to move the handset away from their body for better satellite connectivity.</p>
<p>The PTT LINK provides a more natural experience for those who are already familiar with the use of a Palm/Mic (Fist/Mic). The PTT LINK also allows for small groups to listen into and to be a part of the conversation.</p>
<p>The PTT LINK has two modes. Standard and Amplified Modes. The Amplified Mode allows for noisy or windy environments. The PTT Link attaches to the Iridium 9575 Extreme using the charging accessory supplied with the phone.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[ASE BagDock for Iridium 9575 (PTT Enabled)]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<p>The ASE Bag Dock is a first responder bag that works with both the<span>&nbsp;</span>Iridium 9575 Extreme<span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span>9575 Extreme Push-to-Talk (PTT)<span>&nbsp;</span>phones (Handsets). The ASE Bag Dock is specifically and purpose-built for rapid deployment for first responder teams for natural and man-made disasters. The Bag Dock is perfect for use in emergency responder communication systems, or for remote or solo field workers.</p>
<p>The Bag Dock has a magnetic mount antenna that can be placed either on the rooftop of a vehicle or placed onto any nearby structure such as a top of a temporary structure to provide the best possible “view of the sky” to connect with the Iridium in the most robust fashion. This view of the sky is most critical when using the new powerful Iridium Push-to-Talk (PTT) service from Iridium.</p>
<p>Use the antenna inside a vehicle if needed by using suction cups inside the windshield/windscreen. The Bag Dock also eliminates the need for using the Iridium charging accessory that attaches to the base of the phone/handset. It enhances the phone in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides a convenient connection port that uses the Iridium AC or Cigar/Cigarette Charger.</li>
<li>Improves the audio by shipping with a Palm Mic (Microphone speaker)—sometimes referred to a “Fist Mic.”</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<p>The Bag Dock has an integrated battery that can extend the use of the Iridium 9575 by up to 12-19 Hours (depends on usage). Also included with the bag dock is a fist mic/speaker designed to enhance the effectiveness of your PTT communication. Also included with the kit is an auxiliary audio input if you need to integrate into the vehicle’s sound system, or for use with an external speaker.</p>
<p>The Bag Dock has a rugged canvas bag with easy to use velcro flaps to access custom/bespoke areas of the bag such as the antenna, cabling, et cetera. The Bag Dock is also padded to provide impact and dust/dirt protection for both the Iridium 9575 Phone/Handset as well as the Docking Station and Palm Microphone Speaker. It provides a compact package for storing all the accessories for fast and easy deployment at a moment’s notice—We believe this to be the most compact solution currently available for the Iridium 9575.</p>

<p>VSAT equipped vessels can suffer from slow data rates, due to high demand from crew users. Iridium Certus companion service can mitigate these constraints, delivering performance and cargo data alongside the primary VSAT terminal and allowing a ship’s critical business to continue 24/7.</p>
<p>The Iridium VSAT Companion plan enables the OT revolution on-board a vessel, delivering connectivity either as a primary satellite system (Iridium Certus for primary communications); or as part of a hybrid communications system (Iridium Certus as VSAT Companion).</p>
