				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 9602N daughter board (9602 DB) eases the integration of the new Iridium 9602N SBD Transceiver by allowing developers the option to use existing data acquisition controllers purpose-built for the Iridium 9601 SBD Transceiver. All electrical and mechanical features of the Iridium 9601 SBD Transceiver are completely emulated in this drop-in replacement in a low-power, low-cost design. The 9602N DB allows developers to make optional use of the GPS pass-through technology in the Iridum 9602N SBD Transceiver. All TTL to RS232 level shifting is provided in an ultra-low power design.</p>
