				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Mobile Acoustic Scoring System (MASS) is a waterborne, portable, ship-deployable/recoverable range and training tool. MASS scores and analyzes live-fire surface gunnery exercises, air-to-ground weapons exercises, and other test and evaluation events.</p>
<p>The MASS concept is based on the recognition that a projectile will generate a detectable acoustic event when it impacts water. The characteristics of this type of acoustic event can be detected and accurately located with an in-water array of acoustic sensors and digital signal processing technology.</p>
<p>The MASS system consists of acoustic sensors, which are incorporated into six sensor buoys. When an acoustic event occurs the buoys triangulate the location of impact. Global-Positioning Satellite (GPS) receivers provide precise positioning data of the buoys and firing platforms. Upon impact detection, the buoys transmit data to the system controller unit located on the supporting<br />
platform. The system controller calculates and displays the projectileâ€™s impact location in real-time allowing immediate feedback to the firing platform.</p>
