				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Frey Satellite Corporation Iridium&nbsp;SLDMB (iSLDMB) is an innovative, rugged, and compact A-size Self Locating Datum Marker Buoy. The iSLDMB™ was designed and tested to meet the stringent performance requirements of coastguards for Search and Rescue (SAR) operations in the open ocean. The iSLDMB™ design is based on the proven CODE/Davis style oceanographic surface drifters.</p>
<p>The inexpensive and expendable drifter is equipped with several important pieces of technology, including an Iridium&nbsp;bi-directional satellite transmitter, sea surface temperature sensor, and a GPS receiver. Due to the urgency of SAR situations, the iSLDMB is able to communicate critical data within real-time to the end-user with Iridium&nbsp;satellite services. Robustly designed, the iSLDMB™ is air certified and can be deployed from water vessels, helicopters, fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft. Depending on the required data transmission rate, the drifter can experience an operating life between 15-120 days.</p>
