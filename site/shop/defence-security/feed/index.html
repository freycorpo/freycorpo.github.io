				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tracker Software’s intuitive, simple to use graphical user interface (GUI) gives the user complete control of what and how much information is displayed at any one time. For example, an operator may display detailed RDF vector information from a set of receivers for a single device. At the same&nbsp;time, a commander may display an overview of all the tracking activities within a particular area. This&nbsp;includes tags from different tag technologies both received by DTC receivers and imported from third-party systems.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tracker USB Host is a miniature tracking device, for personnel protection or tracking IT hardware. The range of handheld, mobile and fixed site DTC Tracker Receivers can be used to track and locate the Tracker USB Host, enabling the Tag to be tracked in mobile environments as well as into buildings.</p>
<p>The USB Host looks and functions like a USB stick. It is activated by a discrete push button or when put into a PC. When connected to a PC<br />
the internal battery of the USB Host is charged automatically.</p>
<p>The USB Host can be tracked at ranges of 1-5Km with a vehicle-based RDF receiver. This range is extended to 60Km or more when tracked<br />
using an airborne or fixed site infrastructure receiver. In order to save power and to prevent detection by technical surveillance countermeasures (TSCM), the Tracker USB Host can be commanded into a sleep mode by any DTC Tracker receiver to minimise the risk of detection.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tracker uGPS Tag is a miniature tracking device with the benefit of real-time GPS tracking using a dedicated RF link without the need for a commercial bearer and the redundancy of RDF in a small package.</p>
<p>GPS positions can be stored locally on the tag for a pattern of life analysis. Positional information can be recorded based on a number of criteria such as start/stop motion. To keep power consumption to a minimum, a user can retrieve the GPS records via a physical USB<br />
connection.</p>
<p>In order to save power and to prevent detection using technical surveillance countermeasures (TSCM), the Tracker uGPS Tag can be<br />
commanded into a sleep mode by any Tracker receiver. This means that the RF signature of the device is undetectable by scanning<br />
equipment.</p>
<p>In the event of TSCM being carried out, the narrowband and low power nature of the technology transmission means that it is extremely<br />
difficult to detect. As a result, the Tracker uGPS Tag is the perfect solution for tracking ‘technically aware’ subjects.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ‘all in one’ design of the Tracker Standard Tag, with its integrated antenna, battery and magnetic mounting plate, means that the device<br />
is quick and easy to deploy on the subject vehicle. The rugged construction of the tag ensures that it can be deployed in the harshest of<br />
environments underneath a vehicle and be relied upon in mission-critical situations.</p>
<p>The tag can be powered using either an internal Lithium 1/2 AA cell or external power (from battery or vehicle) for extended deployments using the optional battery eliminator.</p>
<p>In order to save power and to prevent detection using technical surveillance countermeasures (TSCM), the Tracker Standard Tag can be commanded into a sleep mode by any Tracker receiver. In sleep mode, the tag does not transmit making it undetectable by scanning equipment. In the event of TSCM being carried out, the narrowband and low power nature of the transmissions mean that it is extremely difficult to detect. As a result, the Tracker Standard Tag is the perfect solution for tracking ‘technically aware’ subjects.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tracker Receiver is designed for mission-critical tracking in GPS denied environments.</p>
<p>Due to the small size and light weight of the Tracker Receiver, it lends itself to mobile and rapid deployment installations. This could be utilising Frey Satellite Corporation discrete DF array or into a vehicle using a dedicated covert array. ‘Carry on’ fits for aircraft are now also a possibility.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tracker Mini allows users to covertly locate or monitor the activity of an RDF beacon without the use of a vehicle-based receiver. This enables RDF beacons to be located within areas such as buildings where other RDF receivers cannot be deployed.</p>
<p>Designed with ease of use and discrete deployment in mind, the user interacts with the Tracker Mini via a smartphone graphical user interface (GUI). This allows the user to conceal the main transceiver component while blending in with the surroundings, monitoring the RDF beacon via the smartphone. The user is provided with graphical feedback pertaining to the signal strength of the beacon, motion state (mobile, held or stopped) and when the last signal was received.</p>
<p>Audio tone feedback is provided to the user via headphones to facilitate a sense of ‘hotter/colder’ in the event that the smartphone GUI is not applicable to the use scenario.</p>
