				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Frey Satellite Corporation Polar Area Weather Station (PAWS) is a compact, rugged, and easy-to-use polar platform that provides quality-controlled data, in harsh weather conditions. Frey Satellite Corporation designed the PAWS for unattended operations at remote sites that require high reliability, low power consumption, and dependable operational performance.</p>
<p>The PAWS surface unit mast is equipped with an Iridium<sup>®</sup> satellite antenna, GPS, air temperature sensor, barometer port, and an optional humidity sensor. The surface temperature sensor is internal to the unit hull assembly. The PAWS also has a wind speed mast assembly consisting of an RM Young anemometer and PNI TCM2.5 compass. The PAWS is capable of transmitting weather-related data on a three-hour interval, over the Iridium<sup>®</sup> satellite network, for a period of one year.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The POPS platform provides meteorological and oceanographic subsurface data, transmitted via Iridium® telemetry (RUDICS).]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Frey Satellite Corporation designed the Polar Ocean Profiling System (POPS) for deployment in the harsh Arctic climate. POPS is an advanced-generation payload for ice platforms. Our experience with sensors, telemetry, and data acquisition have played a major role in the development of the POPS platform.</p>
<p>The POPS platform provides meteorological and oceanographic subsurface data, transmitted via Iridium<sup>®</sup> telemetry (RUDICS). The system consists of five major elements: system controller (CPU), ice platform, meteorological sensors, Iridium<sup>®</sup> data telemetry, and GPS. In addition, POPS includes a subsurface CTD vertical profiling system (NOVA).</p>
<p>The CPU manages all data acquisition, processing, formatting, and messaging. The CPU has been adapted from the highly successful Iridium<sup>®</sup> reporting drifting buoy family of products. The system features a waterproof communication port for easy configuration and verification. The platform power supply consists of two TADIRAN lithium packs for long-term deployment.</p>
<p>The subsurface NOVA profiler is mounted on a 3/16 inch diameter NILSPIN oceanographic cable. The cable is interfaced to the platform using shackles. The inductive modem ground plane is located on the top plate of the platform, and signals are passed to the POPS CPU using a waterproof connector.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Frey Satellite Corporation Inductive Modem UpTempO buoy is an Iridium<sup>®</sup> reporting data collection and processing system, designed for oceanographic and polar applications. The UpTempO is equipped to handle a number of subsurface sensors including: water conductivity, temperature, depth, and dissolved oxygen. The surface sensor suite features; sea surface temperature, barometric pressure (optional), and GPS.</p>
<p>Employing the proven Ice Beacon platform, equipped with a reinforced Ionomer foam collar, the UpTempO is designed for 12 to 18 months of continuous, unattended operation in the harshest of climates and conditions.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Ice Beacons measure ice movement (GPS position), atmospheric parameters, ice thickness and temperatures, and subsurface parameters.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The family of Frey Satellite Corporation Ice Beacons consists of a group of products that use two basic hull shapes and a wide variety of sensors. Ice Beacons measure ice movement (GPS position), atmospheric parameters, ice thickness and temperatures, and subsurface parameters.</p>
<p>Depending on the requirements, either a tubular hull (10 cm diameter by 70 cm) or a large canister hull (54 cm diameter by 30 cm) can be chosen. All hulls are constructed of aluminum. Heights of either hull type can be increased to accommodate additional batteries and/or a larger sensor payload. The tubular hull is intended to be secured in a hole drilled into the ice, providing excellent stability and eliminating the need for guide lines. It has a satellite antenna mast with the GPS antenna located on top. It is particularly compact and light. The canister hull rests directly on the ice surface and has a 10 cm diameter mast containing the satellite antenna.</p>
<p>If external sensors are used, then either waterproof connectors or potted fittings are used to route signal cables. Both beacon types are fully watertight and are activated by the removal of a magnet, which is affixed with Velcro to the outside of the hull.</p>
