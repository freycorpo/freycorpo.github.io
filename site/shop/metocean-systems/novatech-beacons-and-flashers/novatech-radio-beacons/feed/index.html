				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The NOVATECH™ MMB-7500 is a deep rated, miniature form-factor, lightweight, self-contained VHF radio locator beacon. Introduced as part of the new Mini-beacon line, the MMB-7500 has been added to the NOVATECH™ family of asset recovery devices. The new digital circuit controller offers selectable preset frequency channels, along with a range of duty cycle options, resulting in a beacon that can be configured for a range of broadcast specifications.</p>
<p>The NOVATECH™ MMB-7500 is designed for long-term ocean deployments (up to 5 years submerged), with enough power to transmit for up to 20 days. The Mini-Beacon housing includes an integrated conductivity sensor that isolates the unit’s power while submerged and activates the device upon surfacing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The NOVATECH™ RF-700A1 is a self-contained submersible Radio Beacon, designed to assist in the location and recovery of underwater oceanographic equipment.</p>
<p>It may be submerged for long periods of time in ocean depths to 7,300m (24,000 feet). The activation is completely automatic as it utilizes a pressure switch that automatically turns the beacon OFF below 10m, effectively isolating the power source, and ON when it returns above the 10m threshold.</p>
