				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ST-400B is a compact, self-contained Xenon flasher designed to assist in the location and recovery of oceanographic equipment. The low current consumption and regulated circuitry of ST-400B make it ideal for battery operation.</p>
<p>The visual range of the flasher is dependent on background illumination. Adjustable intensity control allows range settings of approximately 2.5 to 4 nautical miles. The daylight OFF switch shuts the flasher OFF during the daylight hours reducing the current drain to approximately 1 milliamp.</p>
<p>Flash rate and intensity are user adjustable. At factory settings, the ST-400B will operate for approximately 14 days (flashing only at night). At lower flash rate and intensity up to 27-day operation can be achieved. The ST-400B can operate approximately 30% longer.</p>
