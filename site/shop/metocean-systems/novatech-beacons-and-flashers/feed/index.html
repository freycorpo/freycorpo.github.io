				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The NOVATECH™ MMB-7500 is a deep rated, miniature form-factor, lightweight, self-contained VHF radio locator beacon. Introduced as part of the new Mini-beacon line, the MMB-7500 has been added to the NOVATECH™ family of asset recovery devices. The new digital circuit controller offers selectable preset frequency channels, along with a range of duty cycle options, resulting in a beacon that can be configured for a range of broadcast specifications.</p>
<p>The NOVATECH™ MMB-7500 is designed for long-term ocean deployments (up to 5 years submerged), with enough power to transmit for up to 20 days. The Mini-Beacon housing includes an integrated conductivity sensor that isolates the unit’s power while submerged and activates the device upon surfacing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The NOVATECH™ RF-700A1 is a self-contained submersible Radio Beacon, designed to assist in the location and recovery of underwater oceanographic equipment.</p>
<p>It may be submerged for long periods of time in ocean depths to 7,300m (24,000 feet). The activation is completely automatic as it utilizes a pressure switch that automatically turns the beacon OFF below 10m, effectively isolating the power source, and ON when it returns above the 10m threshold.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The 12,000m depth rated iBCN Infinity is the next-generation of Frey Satellite Corporation&#039; NOVATECH™ Iridium® satellite beacons, designed for tracking and locating your assets from the surface to the deepest depths.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 12,000m depth rated iBCN Infinity is designed for tracking and locating your assets from the surface to the deepest depths. The self-contained submersible beacon uses the bi-directional capabilities of the Iridium<sup>®</sup> satellite telemetry system, allowing the end user to receive, in near real-time, the GPS location of their asset and also change and send various reporting parameters to the beacon.</p>
<p>The real advantage of the iBCN technology is that if your asset surfaces unexpectedly, and it is outside of typical RF range, the Iridium<sup>®</sup> beacon (upon surfacing) will immediately capture a GPS position and transmit these coordinates, in near real-time, to a destination of your choice. Giving you peace of mind no matter where you are in the world.</p>
