		<description><![CDATA[The 12,000m depth rated iBCN Infinity is the next-generation of Frey Satellite Corporation&#039; NOVATECH™ Iridium® satellite beacons, designed for tracking and locating your assets from the surface to the deepest depths.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 12,000m depth rated iBCN Infinity is designed for tracking and locating your assets from the surface to the deepest depths. The self-contained submersible beacon uses the bi-directional capabilities of the Iridium<sup>®</sup> satellite telemetry system, allowing the end user to receive, in near real-time, the GPS location of their asset and also change and send various reporting parameters to the beacon.</p>
<p>The real advantage of the iBCN technology is that if your asset surfaces unexpectedly, and it is outside of typical RF range, the Iridium<sup>®</sup> beacon (upon surfacing) will immediately capture a GPS position and transmit these coordinates, in near real-time, to a destination of your choice. Giving you peace of mind no matter where you are in the world.</p>
