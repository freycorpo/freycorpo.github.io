				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Surface Velocity Program (SVP, iSVP) drifting buoy is a Lagrangian current-following drifter, designed to track water currents (15 metres depth) beneath the ocean surface. Developed for unattended operation in the oceans of the world, the SVP consists of sensors to acquire meteorological and oceanographic data, a battery power source, and a satellite transmitter that relays the data through either Argos or<span>&nbsp;</span>Iridium<sup>®</sup><span>&nbsp;</span>satellite systems.</p>
<p>The standard SVP is equipped with a sea surface temperature sensor. The SVP&#8217;s holey sock drogue is centered at 15 meters&nbsp;and is sized to provide a drag ratio (drogue frontal area to that of all other submerged frontal areas) in excess of 40:1. Additional sensors can be added. They include;&nbsp;barometric pressure (BP), salinity, and conductivity.&nbsp;The SVP buoy has been a proven&nbsp;data collection asset for&nbsp;the oceanographic, meteorological, and oil and gas markets. Today, major weather forecasting agencies use Frey Satellite Corporation SVP buoys and the SVP is&nbsp;found throughout the world’s oceans.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The iSPHERE is a unique buoy designed for oil spill tracking. Offered as an alternative to the standard ARGOSPHERE drifter, it uses the bi-directional Iridium® satellite system to communicate and to transmit essential scientific data.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The iSPHERE is an expendable, low cost, bi-directional spherical drifting buoy developed to meet the demanding needs of the offshore oil industry, ocean freight industry and the oceanographic scientific community. The buoy was designed specifically to track and monitor oil spill incidences. The iSPHERE drifter also provides the user with essential real-time sea surface temperature data and GPS positional data.</p>
<p>The robust design of the iSPHERE allows the buoy to be deployed effortlessly from a vessel or an oil platform. The standard operating life of the buoy is approximately 6-12 months.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The CODE/DAVIS drifter is equipped with a sea surface temperature sensor, GPS receiver and the option of either Iridium® or ARGOS based satellite telemetry.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The CODE/DAVIS drifter has been designed and tested to meet the performance criteria of the CODE (Coastal Ocean Dynamics Experiment) drifter developed by Dr. Russ Davis of SIO. The CODE/DAVIS drifter is an inexpensive solution to acquire coastal and esturarian water currents within a meter of the water surface.</p>
<p>Utilized by the oceanographic and metrological community, the robust design allows for easy ship deployment. The CODE/DAVIS drifter is equipped with a sea surface temperature<br />
sensor, GPS receiver and the option of either Iridium<sup>®</sup> or ARGOS based satellite telemetry. The drifters operating life is between 3-12 months depending on the required rate of transmission.</p>
