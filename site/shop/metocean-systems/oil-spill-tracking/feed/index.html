				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AIS/IRIDIUM Marking and Tracking Buoy 4950B.AIS/IR-F. This second generation AIS Drifter Buoy with optional IRIDIUM transponder is designed to mark and track oil spill and other floating objects. The marker buoy is designed for quick and easy deployment in an event and its robust design allows for drop launching this marker from up to 30 meters above sea surface, i.e. from helicopters, platforms or elevated decks. Improvements over the previous generation include a magnetic activation switch also indicating AIS status, low self-discharge rechargeable NiMh batteries and an optional integrated LED strobe (for the -F versions) and the optional IRIDIUM transponder.</p>
<p>IRIDIUM communication is especially useful for tracking in remote regions or if the drifters are not to be followed permanently. It is also possible to operate the drifter in IRIDIUM only mode significantly extending the lifespan up to one year making it suitable for applications in marine research like<br />
surface current tracking.</p>
<p>The AIS Marking and Tracking Buoy is developed based on specifications according to the requirements from The Norwegian Clean Sea Association for Operating Companies (NOFO).</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The iSPHERE is a unique buoy designed for oil spill tracking. Offered as an alternative to the standard ARGOSPHERE drifter, it uses the bi-directional Iridium® satellite system to communicate and to transmit essential scientific data.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The iSPHERE is an expendable, low cost, bi-directional spherical drifting buoy developed to meet the demanding needs of the offshore oil industry, ocean freight industry and the oceanographic scientific community. The buoy was designed specifically to track and monitor oil spill incidences. The iSPHERE drifter also provides the user with essential real-time sea surface temperature data and GPS positional data.</p>
<p>The robust design of the iSPHERE allows the buoy to be deployed effortlessly from a vessel or an oil platform. The standard operating life of the buoy is approximately 6-12 months.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The CODE/DAVIS drifter is equipped with a sea surface temperature sensor, GPS receiver and the option of either Iridium® or ARGOS based satellite telemetry.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The CODE/DAVIS drifter has been designed and tested to meet the performance criteria of the CODE (Coastal Ocean Dynamics Experiment) drifter developed by Dr. Russ Davis of SIO. The CODE/DAVIS drifter is an inexpensive solution to acquire coastal and esturarian water currents within a meter of the water surface.</p>
<p>Utilized by the oceanographic and metrological community, the robust design allows for easy ship deployment. The CODE/DAVIS drifter is equipped with a sea surface temperature<br />
sensor, GPS receiver and the option of either Iridium<sup>®</sup> or ARGOS based satellite telemetry. The drifters operating life is between 3-12 months depending on the required rate of transmission.</p>
