		<description><![CDATA[The POPS platform provides meteorological and oceanographic subsurface data, transmitted via Iridium® telemetry (RUDICS).]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Frey Satellite Corporation designed the Polar Ocean Profiling System (POPS) for deployment in the harsh Arctic climate. POPS is an advanced-generation payload for ice platforms. Our experience with sensors, telemetry, and data acquisition have played a major role in the development of the POPS platform.</p>
<p>The POPS platform provides meteorological and oceanographic subsurface data, transmitted via Iridium<sup>®</sup> telemetry (RUDICS). The system consists of five major elements: system controller (CPU), ice platform, meteorological sensors, Iridium<sup>®</sup> data telemetry, and GPS. In addition, POPS includes a subsurface CTD vertical profiling system (NOVA).</p>
<p>The CPU manages all data acquisition, processing, formatting, and messaging. The CPU has been adapted from the highly successful Iridium<sup>®</sup> reporting drifting buoy family of products. The system features a waterproof communication port for easy configuration and verification. The platform power supply consists of two TADIRAN lithium packs for long-term deployment.</p>
<p>The subsurface NOVA profiler is mounted on a 3/16 inch diameter NILSPIN oceanographic cable. The cable is interfaced to the platform using shackles. The inductive modem ground plane is located on the top plate of the platform, and signals are passed to the POPS CPU using a waterproof connector.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AIS/IRIDIUM Marking and Tracking Buoy 4950B.AIS/IR-F. This second generation AIS Drifter Buoy with optional IRIDIUM transponder is designed to mark and track oil spill and other floating objects. The marker buoy is designed for quick and easy deployment in an event and its robust design allows for drop launching this marker from up to 30 meters above sea surface, i.e. from helicopters, platforms or elevated decks. Improvements over the previous generation include a magnetic activation switch also indicating AIS status, low self-discharge rechargeable NiMh batteries and an optional integrated LED strobe (for the -F versions) and the optional IRIDIUM transponder.</p>
<p>IRIDIUM communication is especially useful for tracking in remote regions or if the drifters are not to be followed permanently. It is also possible to operate the drifter in IRIDIUM only mode significantly extending the lifespan up to one year making it suitable for applications in marine research like<br />
surface current tracking.</p>
<p>The AIS Marking and Tracking Buoy is developed based on specifications according to the requirements from The Norwegian Clean Sea Association for Operating Companies (NOFO).</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Ice Beacons measure ice movement (GPS position), atmospheric parameters, ice thickness and temperatures, and subsurface parameters.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The family of Frey Satellite Corporation Ice Beacons consists of a group of products that use two basic hull shapes and a wide variety of sensors. Ice Beacons measure ice movement (GPS position), atmospheric parameters, ice thickness and temperatures, and subsurface parameters.</p>
<p>Depending on the requirements, either a tubular hull (10 cm diameter by 70 cm) or a large canister hull (54 cm diameter by 30 cm) can be chosen. All hulls are constructed of aluminum. Heights of either hull type can be increased to accommodate additional batteries and/or a larger sensor payload. The tubular hull is intended to be secured in a hole drilled into the ice, providing excellent stability and eliminating the need for guide lines. It has a satellite antenna mast with the GPS antenna located on top. It is particularly compact and light. The canister hull rests directly on the ice surface and has a 10 cm diameter mast containing the satellite antenna.</p>
<p>If external sensors are used, then either waterproof connectors or potted fittings are used to route signal cables. Both beacon types are fully watertight and are activated by the removal of a magnet, which is affixed with Velcro to the outside of the hull.</p>
