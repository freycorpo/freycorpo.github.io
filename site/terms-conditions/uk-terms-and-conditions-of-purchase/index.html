<p><strong>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ordering Process</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Supplier will procure all components necessary to fulfil Forecasts (if supplied) and Orders issued in accordance with this Agreement and ensure sufficient capacity is available to achieve the quantities and delivery dates specified in such Forecasts and Orders. Forecasts <span>are for planning purposes only and do not create a commitment on the part of the Buyer.<br />
</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.2&nbsp; &nbsp; The Order constitutes an offer by Buyer to purchase the Works from Supplier in accordance with these Terms.<br />
